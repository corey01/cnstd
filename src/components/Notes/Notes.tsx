          <h3>Children</h3>
          <p>
            While we absolutely love children, we’ve decided to keep our wedding
            a largely adults-only celebration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only children attending will be those who are part of the
            immediate wedding party.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope this gives everyone plenty of time to make arrangements, and
            we’re grateful for your understanding.
